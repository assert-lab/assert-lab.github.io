  I am always excited to work with <strong>curious and motivated PhD students</strong> who want to explore 
  <strong>AI for Software Engineering</strong>—especially in areas such as 
  <strong>requirements</strong>, <strong>testing</strong>, <strong>debugging</strong>, and 
  <strong>repair</strong> for both classical and quantum software. 
  Students with a background in <strong>program analysis</strong>, <strong>AI/ML</strong>, 
  <strong>programming languages</strong>, or <strong>quantum computing</strong> 
  will find many opportunities to do impactful research. 
  Please take a look at some of my recent papers, and if the ideas resonate with you, 
  send me an email. I would love to hear what you are excited to explore at UTD.
