    I am always looking for <strong>motivated PhD students</strong> interested in <strong>AI for Software Engineering</strong> — with a focus on <em>requirements, testing, debugging, and repair</em>.  
    A solid background in <strong>program analysis</strong>, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, or <strong>programming languages</strong> will be especially valuable.  
    If this sounds like you, take a look at some of my recent papers and email me with ideas you would be excited to explore at UTD.
    <br><br>

    💡 <strong>UTD Undergrads:</strong> UTD offers the <strong>RIDE (Research, Inquiry, Design Experience)</strong> program — a great way to get hands-on research experience.  
    If you are interested in joining my RIDE team, email me or <a href="mailto:Joshua.Summers@UTDallas.edu" style="color:#ff6600;">Joshua.Summers@UTDallas.edu</a>.

    🌍 <strong>International Students:</strong> Remote research internships are also available — feel free to reach out to learn more!
