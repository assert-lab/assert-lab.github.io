Hi! I'm a <a href="https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators">predoctoral researcher</a> on the
<a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>, and I'm advised by <a href="https://pdasigi.github.io/">Pradeep Dasigi</a> and <a href="https://jessedodge.github.io/">Jesse Dodge</a>.
<br>
<br>
My research generally spans machine learning and natural language processing, and I'm currently interested in improved model tuning and modularization. I'm also interested in the societal impacts of artificial intelligence, and I started and currently lead AI2's public policy efforts.
<br>
<br>
I received my masters in computational linguistics and bachelors in computer science from the University of Washington, where I worked with <a
  href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jkasai/">Jungo Kasai</a> and <a
  href="https://yangfengji.net/">Yangfeng Ji</a>, and was advised by <a
  href="https://nasmith.github.io/">Noah Smith</a>.
<br>
<br>
I've previously worked on code & program synthesis at <a href="https://x.company/">X, the moonshot
  factory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Labs">Google Labs</a>, language + vision models at AI2, and platform health at <a
  href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I also spent a few years as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> and <a
  href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/display-video-360/">Google</a>. See my
<a href="/assets/CV-jan-23.pdf">CV</a> for more details.
