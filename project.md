  <section class="research-card">
    <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ AI for Software Reliability</h3>
    <p>
      This area explores how artificial intelligence can support the creation of dependable software systems.
      We examine learning-based methods that analyze programs, reason about behavior, and assist developers in improving quality and maintainability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="research-card">
    <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Intelligent Testing and Validation</h3>
    <p>
      Software testing remains central to ensuring correctness. 
      This area focuses on designing intelligent, data-driven techniques for test design and validation,
      leveraging knowledge from code, documentation, and prior executions to improve automation and reduce cost.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="research-card">
    <h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ Trustworthy and Emerging Computing</h3>
    <p>
      As computing expands into new paradigms, such as quantum and hybrid systems,
      ensuring reliability becomes increasingly complex. 
      This area investigates how automated reasoning and AI-driven analysis can enhance assurance and testing for such emerging domains.
