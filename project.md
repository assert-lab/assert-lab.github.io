    <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Robust and Trustworthy AI for Software Engineering</h3>
    <p>
      We study how large language models (LLMs) and AI-based tools can be made more resilient, consistent, 
      and trustworthy when reasoning about source code. 
      This includes understanding how AI systems respond to imperfect or buggy code and designing strategies 
      that improve their reliability in practical software development contexts.

    <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Quality Assurance and Test Intelligence</h3>
    <p>
      This area focuses on advancing automation in software testing‚Äîparticularly in how systems learn to identify 
      correct versus incorrect program behaviors. 
      We investigate intelligent agents that can reason about program outputs, 
      supported by high-quality datasets and evaluation frameworks that reflect real-world testing practices.

    <h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ Data-Centric Foundations for Reliable Testing</h3>
    <p>
      High-quality datasets are critical to developing effective AI for testing and validation. 
      Our research examines how to curate, synthesize, and structure test data derived from human-written tests 
      and other software artifacts, enabling systematic exploration of correctness and coverage in diverse settings.

    <h3>4Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Domain Software Assurance</h3>
    <p>
      Emerging computing paradigms‚Äîsuch as quantum and hybrid software‚Äîpose new challenges for testing and analysis. 
      We explore how classical software engineering principles can enhance the testing of quantum systems, 
      and conversely, how quantum-inspired methods can inform next-generation testing strategies for traditional software.
