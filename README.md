# [Clearly Erroneous](https://martinapugliese.github.io)

This blog uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme, which has been customised. You can find the [credits](#credits) and the [licence](#licence) in this README.

## Original theme docs

* [The original README is self-explanatory](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
* [Docs](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)
* [Quick-start guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
* [Gemified theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/jekyll/gemified-theme-beta/)

## Usage notes here

Installation has followed the quick-start guide above and then the gemified version of the theme has been installed.

* To serve the site locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` (runs on http://127.0.0.1:4000)
* Note that if the config file is modified while you're serving the site locally, you need to restart it to see the edits

### Update theme

Keep the repo up to date with new features from the upstream. If there's too many changed as you've been lazy and haven't updated in a while, so have way too many conflicts to be solved, the best way is create a branch updated with the minima mistakes master and apply your changes on that one.


## On general edits

I've modified things here and there to customise my site. In particular I have:
* edited some text bits in `_data/ui-text.yml`
* added vars in the config to aid usage (e.g., the one for the path to post images)
* changed default paths to images

### Style customisations

I've customised CSS and text defaults here and there.

### On the posts archive on the homepage

I've edited the `_layouts/archive-single.html` to display the date of creation of the post in the archive list as it used to be (was removed in a more recent release).

## On posts

* MathJax is used to display LateX-style maths (added in `head.html`) in `_includes`. Add maths into double dollars.
* There's buttons for sharing a post on socials configured in `_includes/social-share.html`: the twitter one will work fine from local as well, the Facebook and LinkedIn ones will only work when deployed

##Â Categories and tags

I'm using categories and tags for posts - see the Jekyll [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#categories-and-tags). There's pages for the archive of each of them (using the existing layouts with counts of items), respectively at `/categories/` and `/tags/` and each single one is accessible by clicking on it under each post.

Categories, used for macro groups, are (so far):
* "doodledatcard" - the page for it is also surfaced in the navigation
* "places"
* "italian" - for posts in Italian

Categories posts have been placed in their own folder for cleanliness.

Tags are many, there's a little `tags.py` script to look at them - note you can also use the `/tags/` page. The idea is not to make duplicates/variations and keep them controlled.
