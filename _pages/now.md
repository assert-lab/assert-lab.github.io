_This is the page, updated once a month, where I list what I'm currently up to. This idea has been largely inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now) and I decided to do a new "now" page every month; the previous month's one will get posted as a post.
The now page can get updates throughout the month, based on what I do/the progress, it's a living thing - until the next month._

March has just started, so I'm setting the stage for the month - currently concluding the instances of February which has been a pretty hard month in a few regards. Will add some updated here soon.
