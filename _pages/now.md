_This is the page, updated once a month, where I list what I'm currently up to. This idea has been largely inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now) and I decided to do a new "now" page every month; the previous month's one will get posted as a post.
The now page can get updates throughout the month, based on what I do/the progress, it's a living thing - until the next month. The now pages are pretty much written in a stream of consciousness way, I do not edit much - they're meant to convey quick thoughts._

## Work & Life

Busy times with work, lots to ingest, lots to learn, new habits to take in.

## Data vizzing

I'm resuming some Tableau. Despite the fact that I'm continuously gasping for free time and general energies to carry out side projects, I want to improve my data vizzing skills beyond doing hand-drawing. Tableau has a great community and who knows, one day I could think of merging up data analysis skills with visual design, as I'm currently weak there.

## Reading

I'm on a bunch of things (too many as always), but generally loving these two:
* Bill Bryson's "Notes from a small island" - it's very fun, really
* Jules Verne's "20000 leagues under the sea" - classic I'd never read before, it's so good, full of immersive descriptions and a compelling plot!


## Running

Running has resumed, without much of a bang. I'm enjoying going for a run every now and then without putting too much importance behind it - meaning, without caring for speed and length. These days I just do it as part of several other activities rather than the one thing, I just decide on the spot (and based on the weather) what I feel like doing. I have to say though, I recently went for a run and it started pouring, I wouldn't have gone if I'd suspected it beforehand, but oh it was so liberating. Loved it.
