_This is the page, updated once a ~~month~~ quarter (it appeared to be too much to update it once a month, but the first ones have been done monthly), where I list what I'm currently up to. This idea has been largely inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now) and I decided to do a new "now" page every ~~month~~ (quarter); the previous ~~month's~~ (quarter's) one will get posted as a post.
The now page can get updates throughout the ~~month~~ (quarter), based on what I do/the progress, it's a living thing - until the next ~~month~~ quarter. The now pages are pretty much written in a stream of consciousness way, I do not edit much - they're meant to convey quick thoughts._

I may not even do this quarterly, I may do it once I feel there's enough to put down as a separate post.

# Data vizzing

I've resumed some data vizzing, this time I'm tackling D3 again. I've resuscitated my Observable account and started playing around there. My goal is to become good.

# Reading

I'm all on Bill Bryson at the moment. I think I've gradually bought all his books (not that I've read them all, I just read my second of his books so far, but I decided to buy them all) on [WorldOfBooks](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb), which is a way to buy second-hand books, it's pretty convenient and goes in the direction of circular economy, which I really like.

I've also been buying some books about data vizzing, I'm committed - it could be a new career later on, who knows.
