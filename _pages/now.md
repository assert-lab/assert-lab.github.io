_This is the page, updated once a month, where I list what I'm currently up to. This idea has been largely inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now) and I decided to do a new "now" page every month; the previous month's one will get posted as a post.
The now page can get updates throughout the month, based on what I do/the progress, it's a living thing - until the next month. The now pages are pretty much written in a stream of consciousness way, I do not edit much - they're meant to convey quick thoughts._

## Work & Life

I'm changing jobs. After buying a flat, this is the second biggest piece 2021 is bringing me, and it wasn't really planned. But I did need a change, after a wonderful experience, it was just time to continue my career doing something different.

Before starting (mid of the month), I've been taking a break. We're still in pandemic times, so I'm not travelling - I stayed around Edinburgh, and it's fantastic. The weather has turned out pretty nicely, it's been sunny all day all days since the start of June and I've been thoroughly enjoying it by staying out a lot!

I've been reading, walking a lot, doing some running and exercising at the park. All in all, I've been enjoying nature and a bit of calm time for myself - which is what I like to do.

There's lots of cha these days about doing what matters to you and I have to say I realised what is it that makes me feel good: being a quiet person doing simple things. I'll try to keep this balance alive so to avoid the stress of the past.
