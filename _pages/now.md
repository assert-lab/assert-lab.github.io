_This is the page, updated once a month, where I list what I'm currently up to. This idea has been largely inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now) and I decided to do a new "now" page every month; the previous month's one will get posted as a post.
The now page can get updates throughout the month, based on what I do/the progress, it's a living thing - until the next month._

It's already April. It's a bit of a difficult period here, so I've not been as updatey as I would have liked, based on the fact that I am writing my now page for April today, and it's the 17th of April!

## Data Science and Book Writing

I had launched a survey to my network to collect ideas and opinions for the book I'm writing about data science careers. It was a success, I think, given that so far I had 60 respondents (as of today) - way more than I'd have expected. Happy!

The book hasn't seen any progress in terms of written stuff, but I have had very many conversations with friends and colleagues, which have majorly helped me shape my thinking more. I've also got to know about the great [book](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science) by E Robinson and J Nolis on the same topic, so I want to obviously not repeat content. I still have to find a real lead for my book, and I've also been doing some reading on how to write well, so there is progress, conceptually. More on this soon - there's been much thinking on what data science means these days and where we think the field is going - I just really need to find the headspace to put this all down in a coherent narrative and to find a good focus for my writing.

## Life!

Bunch of things here, which I don't feel like writing up publicly, but there'll be developments soon. A lot of things (side projects I carry out) have been a bit stalled because of this.
