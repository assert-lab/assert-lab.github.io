title: Things I like
---

This page is a living document where I list things I really like. It's a list of lists and points to tools. I'm quite obsessed with making lists to be honest.

## Watch and read

* **Movies, shows** - I use **The Movie Database** to keep track of stuff I like in [lists](https://www.themoviedb.org/u/martina.physics/lists)
* **Books** - I still use **goodreads**, here's my [books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/92719498?ref=nav_mybooks), sometimes with reviews. It's got an outdated interface and since Amazon bought it looks almost like it's been abandoned, but I don't yet have enough of a strong reason to move. Storygraph is at the back of my mind though.


## Podcasts

I've been using **Pocket Casts** for ages, it's good. [Here]({{site.url}}/podcasts/)'s my favourite shows.


## Tools

* I use *Readwise* for both RSS feeds and newsletters, it's really useful
* I have my own newsletter on *Buttondown* - read [here](https://martinapugliese.github.io/doodling-data-reloaded/) about why I moved away from Substack
* **Recipes**: the [CookBook app](https://thecookbookapp.com/) is great, to the point I bought a lifetime subscription
* I use AnkiApp for my **language learning** (flashcards) - quite an old fashioned design but honestly this is trumped by the quality and range of features. I also use [Seedlang](https://www.easygerman.org/app) which is really well made
