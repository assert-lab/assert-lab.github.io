Hi there! I am currently a Software Engineer at Zalando SE, where I spend most of my time building and operating event-driven systems.

I'm on a journey to spend ~10,000 hours tinkering with software systems and jotting down notes along the way.

My past experiences include building backend systems and native Android applications in financial services, customer relationship management, and facility management.

My current interests lie in databases, distributed systems, and search technologies. I also dedicate time mentoring and contributing to startups.
