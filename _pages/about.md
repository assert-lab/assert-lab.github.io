I am deeply fascinated by all aspects of *emotion* research. I am particularly interested in exploring how emotions influence our thoughts and behaviors, and how they are expressed and perceived across different cultures and languages. Currently, my MPhil research mainly focuses on the production and perception of Cantonese emotional speech.
