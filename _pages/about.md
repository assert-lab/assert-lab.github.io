Hi! Glad you popped up here.

I am a physicist by studies and work in/with **data science** (since the glorious times it was uncool, the pre-2010s era). I love **science**, you can read some of my thinking and journey in this <a href="{{ site.url }}/crossing-the-barriers" target="_blank">old post</a>. I also love quantified information and this blog has got some stuff about data and data science, both technical things and meta-things. I do **hand-drawn data vizs** as well (see below in my projects), I really enjoy the display of information in a visual way.

As I do love **drawing** in general, I also draw several things not related to data (cartoons, landscapes from photos) as well - my Instagram will have some, alongside a bunch of other stuff.

I'm Italian and also a great fan of **linguistics** and languages, some of my research when in academia was indeed about the evolution of natural languages - I've done a PhD in Physics with a focus on quantitative Linguistics, which may seem an inconsistent coupling but it's actually a very fruitful one: coming from the Physics of complex systems you can apply methodologies and frameworks to other disciplines and help investigate (so, in collaboration) open questions quantitatively. Beside Linguistics, I love **languages** in general and taught myself some. I make large use of a thesaurus when writing. This blog has a few posts about languages & related things. If you want to know more about my research you can have a look at my [scientific publications](#my-scientific-publications).

I obviously **code** in my job but also for personal projects & for fun - I like it and am a great fan of open source (thanks everyone!). There's some posts here which work a bit like tutorials: it may be that something such as an installation or a library not well documented frustrates me, so after figuring out the solution I write about it - it's my way of giving back to the community of developers who create the software I use. Or it may just be that I fancy illustrating some concept or topic.
These days, I mostly code in Python, but I have to say I kinda miss the days of physics simulations in C++ (or Fortran at times). I run, together with some wonderful co-orgs, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Edinburgh" target="_blank">PyData Edinburgh</a> meetup community, which has been a dazzling journey so far - lots learned, lots of fun, many good chats.

Here, the "Data stuff" category lists the post where I've done something quantitative with data, it excludes those which are more opinion pieces on data science. I also have a category for tech writing, which encompasses little tutorials or explanations/discoveries in programming and general tech.

Apart from data, coding and language things, there's also posts here over various random topics - places I've been to, leadership ideas, opinions, anything else coming to mind.

## Ongoing projects

These are things I'm curating at the moment, or perennial works-in-progress.

### Tales of Science & Data

 <a href="https://martinapugliese.gitbook.io/tales-of-science-and-data/" target="_blank">**Tales of Science & Data**</a> is a collection of notes on topics of data science I wrote, and keep editing, it's a Gitbook. This project started when I had a bunch of notebooks with hand-written notes (I love hand-writing other than hand-drawing by the way!) and I decided it was about time I'd give them a digital form: both for myself, to avoid the ugly job of having to add notes over notes on paper, for any supplement, and in order to share with others.

### DoodleDatCard

**Doodling Data Cards** (aka **DoodleDatCard**) (<a href="https://twitter.com/DoodleDatCard" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/doodledatcard/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>) - my hand-drawn data stories, on cards. Some of these cards are accompanied by a post, in the "Data" category here <a href="/categories/#data" target="_blank">here on this blog</a>. I'm quite erratic in the topics I explore, either I have a question to answer, go look for data and display it, or I see/hear some data somewhere and I decide to give it a visual form.
