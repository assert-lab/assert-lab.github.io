Hi, I'm Martina. Glad you popped up here.

## The short one

I am a scientist by background and I've been working in data science/Machine Learning/AI (you name it) for a few (!) years now. I also doodle data, write about tech, data and sciency things, and share about what I learn. This blog is my lil' [public garden](https://posit.co/resources/videos/your-public-garden/). I'm not the prolific writer I aim to be, but I try.

## The longer version

My name is Martina Pugliese, I am a physicist by studies and I've been working in/with **data science** since the glorious times it was still uncool. I love **science** and have this annoying obsession towards finding quantitative explanations for things. You can read some of my thinking and scientific journey in this <a href="{{ site.url }}/crossing-the-barriers" target="_blank">old post</a>. On the side, I produce **hand-drawn data vizzes** on various topics, usually lightweight (but not just), which I share here (and there).

*You can sign up to my newsletter here - it has funky vizzes, some sciency/techy divertissements and some opinion pieces on tech too.*

I'm Italian and a great fan of **linguistics** and languages, some of my research when in academia was about the evolution of natural languages - I've completed a PhD in Physics with a focus on quantitative Linguistics, which may seem like a weird coupling but it's actually a very fruitful one: you can apply methodologies and frameworks of Physics to other disciplines and help investigate open questions quantitatively. If you want to know more about my research you can have a look at my [scientific publications](https://github.com/martinapugliese/martinapugliese/blob/main/scientific_publications.md){:target="_blank"}.

For four years I ran, together with some wonderful co-orgs, the Edinburgh chapter of the [PyData meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Edinburgh), which has been a fantastic journey - lots learned, lots of fun, greal folks met, many good chats.

## Speaking

I regularly speak about topics related to data, from reflections on the field to technical ones. You can see a list of talks I've given [here](https://github.com/martinapugliese/martinapugliese/blob/main/speaking.md){:target="_blank"}.
