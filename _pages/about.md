Hi there! I am a budding software engineer with so many thoughts running through my mind, and I hope to pen it down on this blog. I love technology, politics, software engineering, and Jesus Christ.

In the past 2+ years, I have worked in a startup environment as well as embarked on freelance projects building mobile applications with Android & Kotlin as well as backend applications in Node.js.

These days, I learn and solve problems using the Scala programming language. <strong>A huge emphasis on learning</strong>.

In my free time, I  `work out`, `cook`, `read`, and `participate in interesting discussions on personal development, technology and history`.
