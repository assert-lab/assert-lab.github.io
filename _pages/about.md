Hi there! I am a software engineer with so many thoughts running through my mind, and I hope to pen some of it down here. I love cake, tech, software engineering, and Christ.

I currently work full time in Lagos, Nigeria. Most of my work have been building native mobile applications in Android (Kotlin) and backend systems using Node.js and Scala.

I am currently exploring projects in Scala (Akka & FP) and multiplatform mobile.

In my free time, I  `cook`, `read`, `watch movies`, `work out`, and `volunteer in technology and humanitarian communities`.
