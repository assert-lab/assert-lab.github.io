Hi there! I am a Software Engineer at Zalando SE, spending most of my time on the design, development, and improvement of resilient and scalable distributed systems.

I am currently on a journey of spending ~10,000 hours on tinkering through software systems, reading, and scribbling technical notes. (_Still a long way to go!_ 😄)

Some of my past experiences are in building backend systems and native Android applications in financial services, customer relationship, and facility management.

My current interests are reading engineering blogs/papers, understanding distributed systems, startups/scale-ups, soccer ⚽️, and cooking 🧑🏽‍🍳.
