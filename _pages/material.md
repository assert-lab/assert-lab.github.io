*üìö You can learn a lot for free on the Internet. This page puts together resources on data, data science and related fields which I find absolutely brilliant. I also list some awesome books (I will specify if they are freely available).*

_**This list is continuously updated.**_


## üìä Statistics, Probability and the science of Data

* *C Bergstrom, J West*, [**Calling Bullshit in the age of Big Data**](http://callingbullshit.org/), course about the manipulative use of data and the wrong use of statistics. The authors have also published a book.
* [book] *D Huff*, [**How to lie with Statistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics) (1954), nice little book on the common mistakes and misunderstandings aroud data. Old but very valuable and entertaining. Note: some of the examples used can be perceived as sexist and out of place today, so keep in mind to contextualise to the 1950s.
* *T Vigen*, [**Spurious Correlations**](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations), visually displays correlations between completely unrelated variables, to illustrate the old adage that <em>correlation is not causation</em>. A favourite within the data community.
* [book] *A B Downey*, [**Think Stats**](https://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/thinkstats.pdf) (O'Reilly 2011), freely available online.
* [**Seeing Theory**]("https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/index.html), a visual introduction to probability and statistics, a site built by students at Brown University.
* *W Chen*, [**Probability Cheatsheet**](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bf3241e4b0f0d81bf7ff36/t/55e9494fe4b011aed10e48e5/1441352015658/probability_cheatsheet.pdf).
* [**The Scipy Lecture Notes**](http://scipy-lectures.org/index.html), brilliant and obviously focussed on Python, but useful for general concepts too.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning - general material

* *S Yee, T Chu*, [**R2D3**](http://www.r2d3.us/), visual intro to Machine Learning.
* *V Powell, L Lehe*, [**Explained Visually**](https://setosa.io/ev/), another visual site.
* [book] *C Molnar*, [**Interpretable Machine Learning**](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) (Leanpub 2019), freely available.
* [book] *T Hastie, R Tibshirani, J Friedman*, [**The Elements of Statistical Learning**](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf) (Springer 2001), freely available.
* [book], *G James, D Witten, T Hastie, R Tibshirani*, [**Introduction to Statistical Learning**](https://www.statlearning.com/) (Springer 2013), a more high-level book by some of the same authors of the above. Again, freely available - it exists in versions with R and Python code examples (the latter adds J Taylor as author).
* [scikit-learn docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), tutorials and extensive explanations for every supported algorithm as well as general notes on Machine Learning concepts.

## üß† Neural Networks & Deep Learning

* [book] *M Nielsen*, [**Neural Networks & Deep Learning**](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)(Determination Press 2015), a fantastic online book, free.
* *V Maggio*, [**>Deep Learning with Keras & Tensorflow**](https://github.com/leriomaggio/deep-learning-keras-tensorflow), a set of tutorials in Jupyter notebooks.
* [book] *F Chollet*, **Deep Learning with Python** (Manning 2017), a book by the creator of Keras (not free).
* [**The TensorFlow Neural Network playground**](http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&amp;batchSize=10&amp;dataset=circle&amp;regDataset=reg-plane&amp;learningRate=0.03&amp;regularizationRate=0&amp;noise=0&amp;networkShape=4,2&amp;seed=0.26634&amp;showTestData=false&amp;discretize=false&amp;percTrainData=50&amp;x=true&amp;y=true&amp;xTimesY=false&amp;xSquared=false&amp;ySquared=false&amp;cosX=false&amp;sinX=false&amp;cosY=false&amp;sinY=false&amp;collectStats=false&amp;problem=classification&amp;initZero=false&amp;hideText=false), an interactive tool to visualise the inner workings of ANNs.

## üëÄ Computer Vision

* [**The Hypermedia Image Processing Reference**](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/index.htm), website built by the University of Edinburgh, School of Informatics.
* *A Rosebrock*, [**Pyimagesearch**](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/), website with tutorials and explanations on Computer Vision and Machine/Deep Learning. Material now for purchase.

## üíª Coding and Computer Science

* [**Sorting Algorithms**](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms), Toptal.
* [book] *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*, **Cracking the Coding Interview** (CareerCup 2008), general resource not just to prepare for interviews but for general challenges.

### üêç Python

* *C Moffitt*, [**Practical Business Python**](https://pbpython.com/), website devoted to best practices on using Python for practical reasons.
* [book] *K Reitz, T Schlusser*, [**The Hitchhiker's guide to Python**](https://docs.python-guide.org/) (O'Reilly 2016), freely available.
