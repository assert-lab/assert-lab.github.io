excerpt: Python's antigravity package explored
---

Python's got a neat list of easter eggs, of which `antigravity` is one. What it does when you call it as

```py
import antigravity
```

is simply opening up this XKCD comic [page](https://xkcd.com/353/){:target="_blank"} which is about Python.

Now, the module was created in [2008](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/import-antigravity.html){:target="_blank"} with just that purpose, and soon afterwards an egg inside the egg was added, looking at the [commit history](https://github.com/python/cpython/commits/master/Lib/antigravity.py){:target="_blank"}. The second egg implements XKCD's geohashing algorithm, explained in [this comic](https://xkcd.com/426/){:target="_blank"}, which is also used for a [game](https://geohashing.site/geohashing/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}.

You can call it as, say,

```py
antigravity.geohash(100,120,b'2020-12-06 30218.26')
```

Give it a try!
