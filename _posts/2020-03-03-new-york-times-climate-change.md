excerpt: Looking at the trend in time of the climate change articles on the New York Times
---

I was interested in looking at the media coverage in time of the topic of climate change.

Why the NYT - because it's a respectable paper, based in the US but read internationally. Also because it has a decent search feature, unlike others (say the Guardian, which I tried using as the European counterpart, which uses Google to search and doesn't straightforwardly allow for time-frame filtering).

Came up with this card [...]

Keyword search so the results may overlap, e.g., those including both phrases will appear in both.

Had to do manually. Not sure how the science one don't appear for total counts.
