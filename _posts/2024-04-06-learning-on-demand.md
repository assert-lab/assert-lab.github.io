excerpt: "Do you feel like you know very little?"

I once witnessed a presentation from a Staff Engineer (SE) in my organization, where they showcased a new tool they had built to track the granular cost of services operated by each team, adding different layers of visualization and aggregation that were also appealing to non-technical folks.

[Who is a Staff Engineer? ‚Äî Think of an individual three (3) levels above a Junior Engineer.]

Days after the presentation, I chatted with them to understand how they approach learning new concepts or technologies in the industry after several years of experience. They explained that they had just picked up a new programming language and decided to find relevant use cases based on their current technical domain. As an engineer at that level, their impact is mostly measured beyond the act of writing code or engaging in regular team rituals, but through other aspects such as providing technical leadership and steering best practices. Hence, my surprise. üò≤

They further explained that, with experience, they have learned to embrace the unknown, especially with a plethora of new and shiny ‚Äúthings‚Äù in the industry. One attribute that has guaranteed their growth has been the discipline to be proficient in the fundamental aspects while being content to learn the skills required at each point along the way. From my experience, this is one of the most challenging traits to develop; we are wired to jump too early at the news of a shiny tool or technology. I know we hear this often, and it is indeed challenging; trust me ü§´.

Don't get me wrong; it is okay to stay updated on trends, but knowing where to invest our time and energy is more important.

**Learning point**: Keep at it. Stay humble and keep learning.
