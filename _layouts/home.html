Hi! I'm a <a href="https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators">predoctoral researcher</a> on the
<a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>, where I work broadly
on problems in machine learning, natural language processing, and AI policy. I've been awarded an <a href="">NSF Computer Science Graduate
  Fellowship</a>,
and I'm advised by <a href="https://pdasigi.github.io/">Pradeep Dasigi</a> and <a
  href="https://jessedodge.github.io/">Jesse Dodge</a>.

<h4 id="research">Research Interests</h4>
My research generally spans machine learning and natural language processing. I work to improve and better
understand modern language models, and I've recently focused on efficiently adapting them to specialized
domains, building better evaluations, and measuring and reporting the environmental impact of AI.
<br><br>
I'm also a strong supporter of open science. I've contributed to various openly released tools
and platforms including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00838">OLMo</a>, <a
  href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00159">Dolma</a>, <a
  href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench">RewardBench</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02060">OLMoE</a>, with more coming soon. <h4 id="policy">
  Public Policy</h4>
I spend a portion of my time helping policymakers understand and address the societal impacts of
advances in AI. I started and currently lead AI2's public policy efforts,
through which I regularly engage with policymakers at the local, state, and federal levels. I previously
served on the City of Seattle's Generative AI Policy Advisory Group.

<h4 id="education">Education & Experience</h4>
I received my masters in computational linguistics and bachelors in computer science from the University of Washington,
where I worked with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jkasai/">Jungo Kasai</a> and <a
  href="https://yangfengji.net/">Yangfeng Ji</a>, and was advised by <a href="https://nasmith.github.io/">Noah
  Smith</a>.
<br>
<br>
I've previously worked on code & program synthesis at <a href="https://x.company/">X, the moonshot
  factory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Labs">Google Labs</a>, language + vision models at AI2,
and platform health at <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I also spent a few years as a software engineer at <a
  href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> and <a
  href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/display-video-360/">Google</a>. See my
<a href="/assets/CV-03.19.2024.pdf">CV</a> for more details.

<h4 id="Service">Service</h4>
In my free time, I serve in a number of positions in the UW Alumni Association including as a
<a href="https://uwimpact.org/district-dawgs/">District Dawg</a>, on the
<a href="https://www.washington.edu/alumni/about-uwaa/gold-alumni-council/">GOLD Council</a>,
and as an early career mentor. I'm also on the <a
  href="https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods1/programs-and-services/major-institutions-and-schools/major-institution-advisory-committees/university-of-washington">City
  University Community Advisory Committee</a>,
where I help advise on major capital projects on UW's campus as well as in the greater University District.
