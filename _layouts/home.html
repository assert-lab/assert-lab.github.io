<!-- Hi! I'm a <a href="https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators">Predoctoral Young Investigator</a> on the
<a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>, and I'm currently working with [person1] and [person2].
<br>
<br>
I recently finished my masters in computational linguistics at the University of Washington, where I worked with <a
  href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jkasai/">Jungo Kasai</a> and was advised by <a
  href="https://nasmith.github.io/">Noah Smith</a>.
<br>
<br>
In the past I've worked on code & program synthesis at both <a href="https://x.company/">X, the moonshot
  factory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Labs">Google Labs</a>, language + vision models on the
<a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>, and platform health at <a
  href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I
also spent a few years as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> and <a
  href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/display-video-360/">Google</a> before coming back to academia. See my
<a href="/assets/CV.pdf">CV</a> for more details.
<br>
<br>
I also graduated with a B.S. in computer science from the University of Washington in 2017, where I worked with <a
  href="https://yangfengji.net/">Yangfeng Ji</a> and Noah Smith. -->

Hi! I'm a masters student in <a href="https://compling.uw.edu/">computational linguistics</a> at the <a
  href="https://uw.edu">University of
  Washington</a>, and I'm broadly interested in machine learning for natural language processing. I'm advised
by <a href="https://nasmith.github.io/">Noah Smith</a>. I'm also currently a teaching assistant for <a
  href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse447/22au/">CSE 447: Natural Language Processing</a>.
<br>
<br>
Update: I'll be starting as a <a href="https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators">Predoctoral Young
  Investigator</a> on the
<a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a> in January!
