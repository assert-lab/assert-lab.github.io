I'm an incoming masters student at the University of Washington, where I'll be working on problems in machine learning and natural language processing.
<!-- I'll be starting my masters degree in <a href="https://compling.uw.edu/">computational linguistics</a> at the University of Washington in September 2021. I also graduated with a B.S. in computer science from UW in 2017, where I worked with <a href="https://yangfengji.net/">Yangfeng Ji</a> and <a href="https://nasmith.github.io/">Noah Smith</a>. -->
<br>
<br>
Before starting grad school, I'll be building language + vision models on the <a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>, and working on the platform health data science team at Twitter. I previously spent a few as a software engineer at both Tableau and Google.
