I'm an incoming masters student at the University of Washington, where I'll be working on problems in machine learning and natural language processing.
<br>
<br>
Before starting grad school, I'll be building language + vision models on the <a href="https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href="https://allenai.org/">AI2</a>, and investigating bias in machine learning models on the platform health data science team at Twitter. I also spent a few years as a software engineer at Tableau and Google.
<br>
<br>
I graduated with a B.S. in computer science from the University of Washington in 2017, where I worked with <a href="https://yangfengji.net/">Yangfeng Ji</a> and <a href="https://nasmith.github.io/">Noah Smith</a>.
